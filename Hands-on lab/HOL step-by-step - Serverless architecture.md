# Serverles architecture hands-on lab step-by-step 

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hand-on lab, you will be challenged to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Microsoft Azure Functions, Azure Cosmos DB, Event Grid, and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, workflows, and monitoring, using various components of Microsoft Azure. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

At the end of the hands-on-lab, you will have confidence in designing, developing, and monitoring a serverless solution that is resilient, scalable, and cost-effective.

## Overview

Contoso Ltd. is rapidly expanding their toll booth management business to operate in a much larger area. As this is not their primary business, which is online payment services, they are struggling with scaling up to meet the upcoming demand to extract license plate information from a large number of new tollbooths, using photos of vehicles uploaded to cloud storage. Currently, they have a manual process where they send batches of photos to a 3rd-party who manually transcodes the license plates to CSV files that they send back to Contoso to upload to their online processing system. They want to automate this process in a way that is cost effective and scalable. They believe serverless is the best route for them, but do not have the expertise to build the solution.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![The Solution diagram is described in the text following this diagram.](media/image2.png 'Solution diagram')

The solution begins with vehicle photos being uploaded to an Azure Storage blobs container, as they are captured. A blob storage trigger fires on each image upload, executing the photo processing **Azure Function** endpoint (on the side of the diagram), which in turn sends the photo to the **Cognitive Services Computer Vision API OCR** service to extract the license plate data. If processing was successful and the license plate number was returned, the function submits a new Event Grid event, along with the data, to an Event Grid topic with an event type called "savePlateData". However, if the processing was unsuccessful, the function submits an Event Grid event to the topic with an event type called "queuePlateForManualCheckup". Two separate functions are configured to trigger when new events are added to the Event Grid topic, each filtering on a specific event type, both saving the relevant data to the appropriate **Azure Cosmos DB** collection for the outcome, using the Cosmos DB output binding. A **Logic App** that runs on a 15-minute interval executes an Azure Function via its HTTP trigger, which is responsible for obtaining new license plate data from Cosmos DB and exporting it to a new CSV file saved to Blob storage. If no new license plate records are found to export, the Logic App sends an email notification to the Customer Service department via their Office 365 subscription. **Application Insights** is used to monitor all of the Azure Functions in real-time as data is being processed through the serverless architecture. This real-time monitoring allows you to observe dynamic scaling first-hand and configure alerts when certain events take place.

## Requirements

-  Microsoft Azure subscription (non-Microsoft subscription)
-  Local machine or a virtual machine configured with (**complete the day before the lab!**):
    - Visual Studio Community 2017 or greater, **version 15.4** or later

    - .NET Framework 4.7 runtime (or higher)
        -  <https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows>
-  Office 365 account. If required, you can sign up for an Office 365 trial at:
    - <https://portal.office.com/Signup/MainSignup15.aspx?Dap=False&QuoteId=79a957e9-ad59-4d82-b787-a46955934171&ali=1>
-  GitHub account. You can create a free account at <https://github.com>.

## Exercise 1: Azure data, storage, and serverless environment setup

**Duration**: 10 minutes

You must provision a few resources in Azure before you start developing the solution. Ensure all resources use the same resource group for easier cleanup.

In this exercise, you will provision a blob storage account using the Hot tier, and create two containers within to store uploaded photos and exported CSV files. You will then provision two Function Apps instances, one you will deploy from Visual Studio, and the other you will manage using the Azure portal. Next, you will create a new Event Grid topic. After that, you will create an Azure Cosmos DB account with two collections. Finally, you will provision a new Cognitive Services Computer Vision API service for applying object character recognition (OCR) on the license plates.

### Task 1: Provision the resources

1.  Using a new tab or instance of your browser, navigate to the Azure Management portal, <http://portal.azure.com>.

2.  In the search bar at the top, enter **custom template**, then select **Deploy a custom template**.

3.  Select **Build your own template in the editor**.

4.  Use **Load file** to upload [starter\arm.json](starter/arm.json) (or just cut and paste it in).

5.  Click **Save**.

6.  Select **Create new** for the resource group and give it a suitable name (e.g. **belfastbootcamp**). For the **Suffix** setting, provide a short unique alphanumeric code to avoid clashing with other workshoppers.

7.  Agree to the terms and click **Purchase**.

8.  Once the deployment completes (probably a bit over 5 minutes) your resource group will contain all the required resources, and the function app settings will be in place.

### Task 2: Configure the Azure Cosmos DB account

1.  In the Azure Portal, select the Cosmos DB account in the new resource group.

2.  Select **Browse** in the blade menu, then select **+ Add Collection**.

    ![In the Tollbooths blade, Overview is selected, and the Add Collection button is selected.](media/image25.png 'Tollbooths blade')

3.  On the **Add Collection** blade, specify the following configuration options:

    a. Enter **LicensePlates** for the **Database id**.

    b. Leave **Provision database throughput** unchecked.

    c. Enter **Processed** for the **Collection id**.

    d. Partition key: **/licensePlateText**

    e. Throughput: **5000**

    ![In the Add Collection blade, fields are set to the previously defined settings.](media/cosmosdb-add-processed-collection.png "Add Collection blade")

4.  Select **OK**.

5.  Select **New Collection** to add another collection.

6. On the **Add Collection** blade, specify the following configuration options:

    a. For Database id, choose **Use existing** and select **LicensePlates**.

    b. For Collection id, enter **NeedsManualReview**.

    c. Partition key: **/fileName**

    d. Throughput: **5000**

    ![In the Add Collection blade, fields are set to the previously defined values.](media/cosmosdb-add-manualreview-collection.png 'Add Collection blade')

7. Select **OK**.

### Task 3: Create blob storage containers

1.  Navigate to the blob storage account in the Azure Portal. 

2.  Select **Blobs** under **Blob Service** in the menu. Then select the **+ Container** button to add a new container. In the **Name** field, enter **images**, select **Private (no anonymous access)** for the public access level, then select **OK** to save.

    ![In the Storage blade, under Settings, Containers is selected. In the Containers blade, the + (add icon) Container button is selected. Below, the Name field displays images, and the Public access level is set to Private (no anonymous access).](media/image16.png 'Storage and Containers blade')

3.  Repeat these steps to create a container named **export**.

    ![In the Storage blade, under Settings, Containers is selected. In the Containers blade, the + (add icon) Container button is selected. Below, the Name field displays export, and the Public access level is set to Private (no anonymous access).](media/new-container-export.png 'Storage and Containers blade')

## Exercise 2: Develop and publish the photo processing and data export functions

**Duration**: 30 minutes

Use Visual Studio 2017/2019 and its integrated Azure Functions tooling to develop and debug the functions locally, and then publish them to Azure. The starter project solution, TollBooths, contains most of the code needed. You will add in the missing code before deploying to Azure.

| Code and test Azure Functions locally | <https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local> |

### Task 1: Finish the ProcessImage function

There are a few components within the starter project that must be completed, marked as TODO in the code. The first set of TODO items we will address are in the ProcessImage function, the FindLicensePlateText class that calls the Computer Vision API, and finally the SendToEventGrid.cs class, which is responsible for sending processing results to the Event Grid topic you created earlier.

> **Note:** Do **NOT** update the version of any NuGet package. This solution is built to function with the NuGet package versions currently defined within. Updating these packages to newer versions could cause unexpected results.

1.  Navigate to the **TollBooth** project using the Solution Explorer of Visual Studio.

2.  From the Visual Studio **View** menu, select **Task List**.

    ![The Visual Studio Menu displays, with View and Task List selected.](media/image37.png 'Visual Studio Menu')

3.  There you will see a list of TODO tasks, where each task represents one line of code that needs to be completed.

> ![A list of TODO tasks, including their description, project, file, and line number display.](media/image38.png 'TODO tasks')

1.  Open **ProcessImage.cs**. Notice that the Run method is decorated with the FunctionName attribute, which sets the name of the Azure Function to "ProcessImage". This is triggered by HTTP requests sent to it from the Event Grid service. You tell Event Grid that you want to get these notifications at your function's URL by creating an event subscription, which you will do in a later task, in which you subscribe to blob-created events. The function's trigger watches for new blobs being added to the images container of the storage account that was created in Exercise 1. The data passed to the function from the Event Grid notification includes the URL of the blob. That URL is in turn passed to the input binding to obtain the uploaded image from Blob storage.

2.  The following code represents the completed task in ProcessImage.cs:

```csharp
// **TODO 1: Set the licensePlateText value by awaiting a new FindLicensePlateText.GetLicensePlate method.**

licensePlateText = await new FindLicensePlateText(log, _client).GetLicensePlate(licensePlateImage);
```

6.  Open **FindLicensePlateText.cs**. This class is responsible for contacting the Computer Vision API to find and extract the license plate text from the photo, using OCR. Notice that this class also shows how you can implement a resilience pattern using [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly), an open source .NET library that helps you handle transient errors. This is useful for ensuring that you do not overload downstream services, in this case, the Computer Vision API. This will be demonstrated later on when visualizing the Function's scalability.

7.  The following code represents the completed task in FindLicensePlateText.cs:

```csharp
// TODO 2: Populate the below two variables with the correct AppSettings properties.
var uriBase = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("computerVisionApiUrl");
var apiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("computerVisionApiKey");
```

8.  Open **SendToEventGrid.cs**. This class is responsible for sending an Event to the Event Grid topic, including the event type and license plate data. Event listeners will use the event type to filter and act on the events they need to process. Make note of the event types defined here (the first parameter passed into the Send method), as they will be used later on when creating new functions in the second Function App you provisioned earlier.

9.  The following code represents the completed tasks in SendToEventGrid.cs:

```csharp
// TODO 3: Modify send method to include the proper eventType name value for saving plate data.
await Send("savePlateData", "TollBooth/CustomerService", data);

// TODO 4: Modify send method to include the proper eventType name value for queuing plate for manual review.
await Send("queuePlateForManualCheckup", "TollBooth/CustomerService", data);
```

### Task 2: Publish the Function App from Visual Studio

In this task, you will publish the Function App from the starter project in Visual Studio to the existing Function App you provisioned in Azure.

1.  Navigate to the **TollBooth** project using the Solution Explorer of Visual Studio.

2.  Right-click the **TollBooth** project and select **Publish** from the context menu.

    ![In Solution Explorer, TollBooth is selected, and in its right-click menu, Publish is selected.](media/image39.png 'Solution Explorer ')

3.  In the Pick a Publish Target window that appears, make sure **Azure Function App** is selected, choose the **Select Existing** radio button, then select **Publish**.

    ![In the Publish window, the Azure Function App tile is selected. Under this, both the Select Existing radio button and the Publish button are selected.](media/vs-publish-function.png 'Publish window')

>**Note**:  If you do not see the ability to publish to an Azure Function, you may need to update your Visual Studio instance.

1.  In the App Service form, select your **Subscription**, select **Resource Group** under **View**, then expand your **ServerlessArchitecture** resource group and select the Function App whose name ends with **FunctionApp**.

2.  Whatever you named the Function App when you provisioned it is fine. Just make sure it is the same one to which you applied the Application Settings in Task 1 of this exercise.

    ![In the App Service form, Resource Group displays in the View field, and in the tree-view below, the ServerlessArchitecture folder is expanded, and TollBoothFunctionApp is selected.](media/image41.png 'App Service form')

3.  After you select the Function App, select **OK**.

    > **Note**:  If prompted to update the functions version on Azure, click **Yes**.

4.  Watch the Output window in Visual Studio as the Function App publishes. When it is finished, you should see a message that says, "Publish Succeeded."

5.  Using a new tab or instance of your browser navigate to the Azure Management portal, <http://portal.azure.com>.

6.  Open the **ServerlessArchitecture** resource group, then select the Azure Function App to which you just published.

7.  Expand the functions underneath your Function App in the menu. You should see both functions you just published from the Visual Studio solution listed.

    ![In the TollBoothFunctionApp blade, in the pane, both TollBoothFunctionApp, and Functions (Read Only) are expanded. Below Functions, two functions (ExportLicensePlates and ProcessImage) are called out.](media/image42.png 'TollBoothFunctionApp blade')

8.  Now we need to add an Event Grid subscription to the ProcessImage function so the function is triggered when new images are added to blob storage. Select the **ProcessImage** function, then select **Add Event Grid subscription**.

    ![The ProcessImage function and the Add Event Grid subscription items are highlighted.](media/processimage-add-eg-sub.png "ProcessImage function")

9.  On the **Create Event Subscription** blade, specify the following configuration options:

    a. **Name**: Unique value for the App name similar to **processimagesub** (ensure the green check mark appears).
    
    b. **Event Schema**: Select Event Grid Schema.
    
    c. For **Topic Type**, select **Storage Accounts**.

    d. Select your **subscription** and **ServerlessArchitecture** resource group.

    e. For resource, select your recently created Event Grid.

    f. _Uncheck_ **Subscribe to all event types**, then select **Blob Created** from the event types dropdown list.

    g. Leave Web Hook as the Endpoint Type.

10. Leave the remaining fields at their default values and select **Create**.

    ![In the Create Event Subscription blade, fields are set to the previously defined settings.](media/processimage-eg-sub.png)

## Exercise 3: Create functions in the portal

**Duration**: 45 minutes

Create two new Azure Functions written in Node.js, using the Azure portal. These will be triggered by Event Grid and output to Azure Cosmos DB to save the results of license plate processing done by the ProcessImage function.

### Task 1: Create function to save license plate data to Azure Cosmos DB

In this task, you will create a new Node.js function triggered by Event Grid and that outputs successfully processed license plate data to Azure Cosmos DB.

1.  Using a new tab or instance of your browser navigate to the Azure Management portal, <http://portal.azure.com>.

2.  Open the **ServerlessArchitecture** resource group, then select the Azure Function App you created whose name ends with **Events**. If you did not use this naming convention, make sure you select the Function App that you _did not_ deploy to in the previous exercise.

3.  Select **Functions** in the menu. In the **Functions** blade, select **+ New Function**.

    ![In the TollBoothEvents2 blade, in the pane under Function Apps, TollBoothEvents2 is expanded, and Functions is selected. In the pane, the + New function button is selected.](media/image43.png 'TollBoothEvents2 blade')

4.  Enter **event grid** into the template search form, then select the **Azure Event Grid trigger** template.  

    a.  If prompted, click **Install** and wait for the extension to install.

    b.  Click **Continue**

    ![In the Template search form, event grid is typed in the search field. Below, the Event Grid trigger function option displays.](media/image44.png 'Template search form')

5.  In the New Function form, fill out the following properties:

    a. For name, enter **SavePlateData**

    ![In the New Function form SavePlateData is typed in the Name field.](media/image45.png 'Event Grid trigger, New Function form')

    b.  Select **Create**.

6)  Replace the code in the new SavePlateData function with the following:

```javascript
module.exports = function (context, eventGridEvent) {
    context.log(typeof eventGridEvent);
    context.log(eventGridEvent);

    context.bindings.outputDocument = {
        fileName : eventGridEvent.data["fileName"],
        licensePlateText : eventGridEvent.data["licensePlateText"],
        timeStamp : eventGridEvent.data["timeStamp"],
        exported : false
    }

    context.done();
};
```

### Task 1: Use the Azure Cosmos DB Data Explorer

1.  Open your Azure Cosmos DB account by opening the **ServerlessArchitecture** resource group, and then selecting the **Azure Cosmos DB account** name.

2.  Select **Data Explorer** from the menu.

    ![In the Tollbooth - Data Explorer blade, Data Explorer is selected.](media/image75.png 'Tollbooth - Data Explorer blade')

3.  Expand the **Processed** collection, then select **Documents**. This will list each of the JSON documents added to the collection.

4.  Select one of the documents to view its contents. The first four properties are ones that were added by your functions. The remaining properties are standard and are assigned by Cosmos DB.

    ![Under Collections, Processed is expanded, and Documents is selected. On the Documents tab, a document is selected, and to the side, the first four properties of the document (fileName, licencePlateText, timeStamp, and exported) are circled.](media/image76.png 'Tollbooth - Data Explorer blade')

5.  Expand the **NeedsManualReview** collection, then select **Documents**.

6.  Select one of the documents to view its contents. Notice that the filename is provided, as well as a property named "resolved". While this is out of scope for this lab, those properties can be used together to provide a manual process for viewing the photo and entering the license plate.

    ![Under Collections, NeedsManualReview is expanded, and Documents is selected. On the Documents tab, a document is selected, and to the side, the first four properties of the document (fileName, licencePlateText, timeStamp, and resolved) are circled.](media/image77.png 'Tollbooth - Data Explorer blade')

7.  Right-click on the **Processed** collection and select **New SQL Query**.

    ![Under Collections, LicencePlates is expanded, and Processed is selected. From its right-click menu, New SQL Query is selected.](media/image78.png 'Tollbooth - Data Explorer blade')

8.  Modify the SQL query to count the number of processed documents that have not been exported:

```sql
SELECT VALUE COUNT(c.id) FROM c WHERE c.exported = false
```

9.  Execute the query and observe the results. In our case, we have 1,369 processed documents that need to be exported.

    ![On the Query 1 tab, under Execute Query, the previously defined SQL query displays. Under Results, the number 1369 is highlighted.](media/cosmos-query-results.png "Query 1 tab")

## Exercise 6: Create the data export workflow

**Duration**: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you create a new Logic App for your data export workflow. This Logic App will execute periodically and call your ExportLicensePlates function, then conditionally send an email if there were no records to export.

### Task 1: Create the Logic App

1.  Navigate to the Azure Management portal, <http://portal.azure.com>.

2.  Select **+ Create a resource**, then enter **logic app** into the search box on top. Select **Logic App** from the results.

    ![In the Azure Portal, in the menu, New is selected. In the New blade, logic ap is typed in the search field, and Logic App is selected in the search results.](media/image80.png 'Azure Portal')

3.  Select the **Create** button on the Logic App overview blade.

4.  On the **Create Logic App** blade, specify the following configuration options:

    a. For Name, type a unique value for the App name similar to **TollBoothLogic** (ensure the green check mark appears).

    b. Specify the Resource Group **ServerlessArchitecture**.

    c. Select the same **location** as your Resource Group.

    d. Select **Off** underneath Log Analytics.

    ![In the Create logic app blade, fields are set to the previously defined settings.](media/image81.png 'Create logic app blade')

5.  Click **Create**.  Open the Logic App once it has been provisioned.

6.  In the Logic App Designer, scroll through the page until you locate the _Start with a common trigger_ section. Select the **Recurrence** trigger.

    ![The Recurrence tile is selected in the Logic App Designer.](media/image82.png 'Logic App Designer')

7.  Enter **15** into the **Interval** box, and make sure Frequency is set to **Minute**. This can be set to an hour or some other interval, depending on business requirements.

8.  Select **+ New step**.

    ![Under Recurrence, the Interval field is set to 15, and the + New step button is selected.](media/image83.png 'Logic App Designer Recurrence section')

9. Enter **Functions** in the filter box, then select the **Azure Functions** connector.

    ![Under Choose an action, Functions is typed in the search box. Under Connectors, Azure Functions is selected.](media/image85.png 'Logic App Designer Choose an action section')

10. Select your Function App whose name ends in **FunctionApp**, or contains the ExportLicensePlates function.

    ![Under Azure Functions, in the search results list, Azure Functions (TollBoothFunctionApp) is selected.](media/image86.png 'Logic App Designer Azure Functions section')

11. Select the **ExportLicensePlates** function from the list.

    ![Under Azure Functions, under Actions (2), Azure Functions (ExportLicensePlates) is selected.](media/image87.png 'Logic App Designer Azure Functions section')

12. This function does not require any parameters that need to be sent when it gets called. Select **+ New step**, then search for **condition**. Select the **Condition** Control option from the Actions search result.

    ![Under ExportLicensePlates, the field is blank. Under the + New step button, Add a condition is selected.](media/logicapp-add-condition.png 'Logic App Designer ExportLicensePlates section')

13. For the **value** field, select the **Status code** parameter. Make sure the operator is set to **is equal to**, then enter **200** in the second value field. 

    >**Note**: This evaluates the status code returned from the ExportLicensePlates function, which will return a 200 code when license plates are found and exported. Otherwise, it sends a 204 (NoContent) status code when no license plates were discovered that need to be exported. We will conditionally send an email if any response other than 200 is returned.

    ![The first Condition field displays Status code. The second, drop-down menu field displays is equal to, and the third field is set to 200.](media/logicapp-condition.png 'Condition fields')

14. We will ignore the If true condition because we don't want to perform an action if the license plates are successfully exported. Select **Add an action** within the **If false** condition block.

    ![Under the Conditions field is an If true (green checkmark) section, and an if false (red x) section. In the If false section, Add an action is selected.](media/logicapp-condition-false-add.png 'Logic App Designer Condition fields if true/false ')

    ![Under Send an email, fields are set to the previously defined settings. ](media/image94.png 'Logic App Designer , Send an email fields')

18. Select **Save** in the tool bar to save your Logic App.

19. Select **Run** to execute the Logic App. You should start receiving email alerts because the license plate data is not being exported. This is because we need to finish making changes to the ExportLicensePlates function so that it can extract the license plate data from Azure Cosmos DB, generate the CSV file, and upload it to Blob storage.

    ![The Run button is selected on the Logic Apps Designer blade toolbar.](media/image95.png 'Logic Apps Designer blade')

20. While in the Logic Apps Designer, you will see the run result of each step of your workflow. A green checkmark is placed next to each step that successfully executed, showing the execution time to complete. This can be used to see how each step is working, and you can select the executed step and see the raw output.

    ![In the Logic App Designer, green check marks display next to Recurrence, ExportLicensePlates, Condition, and Send an email.](media/image96.png 'Logic App Designer ')

21. The Logic App will continue to run in the background, executing every 15 minutes (or whichever interval you set) until you disable it. To disable the app, go to the **Overview** blade for the Logic App and select the **Disable** button on the taskbar.

    ![The Disable button is selected on the TollBoothLogic blade top menu.](media/image97.png 'TollBoothLogic blade')

## Exercise 7: Configure continuous deployment for your Function App

### Task 1: Finish your ExportLicensePlates function code and redeploy

1.  Navigate to the **TollBooth** project using the Solution Explorer of Visual Studio.

2.  From the Visual Studio **View** menu, select **Task List**.

    ![Task List is selected from the Visual Studio View menu.](media/image37.png 'Visual Studio View menu')

3.  There you will see a list of TODO tasks, where each task represents one line of code that needs to be completed.

4.  Open **DatabaseMethods.cs**.

5.  The following code represents the completed task in DatabaseMethods.cs:

```csharp
// TODO 5: Retrieve a List of LicensePlateDataDocument objects from the collectionLink where the exported value is false.
licensePlates = _client.CreateDocumentQuery<LicensePlateDataDocument>(collectionLink,
        new FeedOptions() { EnableCrossPartitionQuery=true,MaxItemCount = 100 })
    .Where(l => l.exported == false)
    .ToList();
// TODO 6: Remove the line below.
```

6.  Make sure that you deleted the following line under TODO 6: licensePlates = new List\<LicensePlateDataDocument\>();.

7.  Save your changes then open **FileMethods.cs**.

8.  The following code represents the completed task in DatabaseMethods.cs:

```csharp
// TODO 7: Asyncronously upload the blob from the memory stream.
await blob.UploadFromStreamAsync(stream);
```

9.  Save your changes.

10. Re-publish the app as you did before in Exercise 2.

## Exercise 8: Rerun the workflow and verify data export

**Duration**: 10 minutes

With the latest code changes in place, run your Logic App and verify that the files are successfully exported.

### Task 1: Run the Logic App

1.  Open your ServerlessArchitecture resource group in the Azure portal, then select your Logic App.

2.  From the **Overview** blade, select **Enable**.

    ![In the TollBoothLogic, the Enable enable button is selected.](media/image113.png 'TollBoothLogic blade')

3.  Now select **Run Trigger**, then select **Recurrence** to immediately execute your workflow.

    ![In the TollBoothLogic blade, Run Trigger / Recurrence is selected.](media/image114.png 'TollBoothLogic blade')

4.  Select the **Refresh** button next to the Run Trigger button to refresh your run history. Select the latest run history item. If the expression result for the condition is **true**, then that means the CSV file should've been exported to Blob storage. Be sure to disable the Logic App so it doesn't keep sending you emails every 15 minutes. Please note that it may take longer than expected to start running, in some cases.

    ![In Logic App Designer, in the Condition section, under Inputs, true is circled.](media/image115.png 'Logic App Designer ')

### Task 2: View the exported CSV file

1.  Open your ServerlessArchitecture resource group in the Azure portal, then select your **Storage account** you had provisioned to store uploaded photos and exported CSV files.

2.  In the Overview pane of your storage account, select **Blobs**.

    ![Under Services, Blobs is selected.](media/image116.png 'Services section')

3.  Select the **export** container.

    ![Export is selected under Name.](media/image117.png 'Export option')

4.  You should see at least one recently uploaded CSV file. Select the filename to view its properties.

    ![In the Export blade, under name, a .csv file is selected.](media/blob-export.png 'Export blade')

5.  Select **Download** in the blob properties window.

    ![In the Blob properties blade, the Download button is selected.](media/blob-download.png 'Blob properties blade')

    The CSV file should look similar to the following:

    ![A CSV file displays with the following columns: FileName, LicensePlateText, TimeStamp, and LicensePlateFound.](media/csv.png 'CSV file')

6.  The ExportLicensePlates function updates all of the records it exported by setting the exported value to true. This makes sure that only new records since the last export are included in the next one. Verify this by re-executing the script in Azure Cosmos DB that counts the number of documents in the Processed collection where exported is false. It should return 0 unless you've subsequently uploaded new photos.

## After the hands-on lab

**Duration**: 5 minutes

In this exercise, attendees will deprovision any Azure resources that were created in support of the lab.

### Task 1: Delete the resource group in which you placed your Azure resources

1.  From the Portal, navigate to the blade of your **Resource Group** and select **Delete** in the command bar at the top.

2.  Confirm the deletion by re-typing the **resource group name** and selecting **Delete**.

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the Hands-on lab.
